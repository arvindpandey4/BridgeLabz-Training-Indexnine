## Core JavaScript (feature/core_js)

Covered fundamental JavaScript concepts:
- Variables and scope (var, let, const)
- Data types and type conversions
- Operators and expressions
- Control flow (if/else, loops, switch)
- Functions and arrow functions
- Arrays and array methods
- Objects and object methods
- String methods and manipulation
- Error handling and try/catch

---

## Advanced JavaScript & OOP (feature/advance_js_oops)

Deep dive into advanced patterns:
- Constructor functions and prototypes
- ES6 Classes and inheritance
- Prototype chain
- this binding and context
- Closures and scope chain
- Higher-order functions
- Callbacks and callback hell
- Promises and Promise chaining
- Async/await
- Event emitters
- Object methods: call, apply, bind
- Decorators and forwarding
- Custom error handling

---

## Node.js Fundamentals (feature/nodejs)

## Key Learnings

1. Master JavaScript fundamentals before moving to advanced concepts
2. Understanding closures is crucial for async programming
3. Event loop and microtasks/macrotasks are essential for async patterns
4. OOP patterns vary: constructor functions, classes, and prototypes
5. DSA implementation helps understand algorithm complexity
6. TypeScript adds type safety and better development experience
