05_exception_handling.ts - Custom errors and exception handling
06_logging.ts - Logger with log levels
07_file_io.ts - File read/write operations
08_address_book.ts - Address Book problem complete implementation
09_generics.ts - Generic types and repositories
10_coding_standards.ts - Coding standards and conventions
11_advanced_types.ts - Union types, mapped types, advanced concepts
12_data_structures.ts - Queue and Stack implementation

### Topics Covered:

## Key Learnings

1. Master JavaScript fundamentals before moving to advanced concepts
2. Understanding closures is crucial for async programming
3. Event loop and microtasks/macrotasks are essential for async patterns
4. OOP patterns vary: constructor functions, classes, and prototypes
5. DSA implementation helps understand algorithm complexity
6. TypeScript adds type safety and better development experience
7. Address Book problem demonstrates full-stack OOP implementation
8. Coding standards ensure maintainability and consistency
