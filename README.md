## AI/ML Review Tasks (feature/ai_ml)

### Review Task 1: Log Validation System

Implemented a log validation system in Python that validates log entries based on specific rules:

**Problem:** Create a function `validate_logs(logs)` that validates a list of log strings.

**Rules:**
- Each log must follow format: `"LEVEL: message"`
- Valid levels: INFO, WARNING, ERROR
- No two ERROR logs can occur consecutively
- Returns True if valid, False otherwise

**Implementation:**
- `task.py` - Core validation logic
- `logs.py` - Comprehensive test suite with 6 test cases
- `README.md` - Documentation and usage examples

**Key Concepts:**
- String parsing and validation
- State tracking (previous log level)
- Edge case handling
- Test-driven development

---

---

## Advanced Backend

Implemented advanced backend features:
- **Redis**: Caching implementation for improved performance (20 notes/user)
- **RabbitMQ**: Message queuing for asynchronous email notifications
- **ESLint**: Code quality and linting configuration
- **Swagger**: API documentation

---

## React.js (feature/react_js)

Practicing React.js frontend concepts:
- Component structure and lifecycle
- State management
- Hooks implementation
- Frontend architecture

---

## Key Learnings

1. Master JavaScript fundamentals before moving to advanced concepts
2. Understanding closures is crucial for async programming
3. Event loop and microtasks/macrotasks are essential for async patterns
4. OOP patterns vary: constructor functions, classes, and prototypes
5. DSA implementation helps understand algorithm complexity
6. TypeScript adds type safety and better development experience
